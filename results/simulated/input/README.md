The file names encode the type of simulated bicluster dataset:

- 4c = 4 column biclusters
- 4r = 4 row biclusters
- nono = nonoverlapping
- over = overlapping
- const = constant
- incr = increasing row or column correlations

The file:
true_indices.txt

contains true indices for implanted biclusters in the shuffled simulated bicluster datasets. The same indices are used for column and row bicluster of a specific type (e.g. nonoverlapping or overlapping, constant vs increasing).

-- The file names encode the type of simulated bicluster dataset:

4c = 4 column biclusters
4r = 4 row biclusters
nono = nonoverlapping
over = overlapping


-- In the R image files (files with no extension):

Ibl1to4R = true row indices for implanted biclusters

Ibl1to4R = true column indicices for implanted biclusters
